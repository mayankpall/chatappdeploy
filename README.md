# Real-Time Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built with the MERN stack, using **Socket.io** for real-time communication and **TailwindCSS** + **Daisy UI** for a responsive, modern user interface. The app is ideal for dynamic teams where members can be added or removed frequently, such as in temporary project environments.

### Live Demo

## Key Benefits

- **Automatic Contact Management**: New users are added automatically, and old users are removed from the contacts list without manual updates.
- **Privacy by Design**: No personal information is shared directly between users. The app updates the contact list automatically to reflect only active users, ensuring minimal data sharing.
- **Flexible Team Setup**: Users can join or leave projects seamlessly. This makes the app perfect for teams that need flexibility, allowing members to collaborate on projects quickly without complicated setup.

This setup ensures that teams can work together without needing to exchange personal contact information repeatedly, providing a secure and efficient communication environment for both short-term and long-term projects.


## Usage

### Testing with a Temporary Team
1. **Add New Users**: Anyone can sign up for a temporary account by providing a username and password on the sign-up page.
2. **Automatic Contact Fetching**: Upon login, the app will automatically fetch and display all online users for easy contact initiation.
3. **Remove Old Users**: Old users can be removed from the database if they are no longer needed. This will automatically update the contacts list for all current users.

### Test Credentials
To test the app without creating a new account, you can log in with the following credentials:

- **Username**: `testuser`
- **Password**: `password`

### Note for Team Use
This chat app is designed for flexibility, with the ability to easily manage temporary users. This means:
- **User data is not retained** after removal, ensuring no lingering personal data.
- **Team members can join and leave** as needed without affecting the core functionality.
